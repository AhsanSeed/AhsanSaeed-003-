Test Scenarios,Morpheus Status Manager Test Scenarios 1,30019363,3692,10521,"<p>The client of this application has a business where the client receives cases from customers. These cases will be assigned to client's financial advisors and a case notification is created in client's existing application for tracking purpose. Advisors are responsible for handling the cases.&nbsp; After handling the cases, advisors will update the status of the case work at their business office.&nbsp; Thus based on case work completeness, the company CSR will update the status of the cases by updating case notification in the application. The existing application which the client uses is a third party vendor application called Status Manager(SM) Tool.&nbsp; The SM tool provides a single view of client current business status.&nbsp; It provides a set of following functionalities:</p>
<p>- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provides an API to create/update/retrieve/search case notifications<br /> - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provides an API to create/update/ retrieve/delete custom views of case notifications<br /> - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capturing alert emails send to financial advisors from&nbsp; business groups(users from client's internal applications)<br /> - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provides an API to define new notification types (email templates) to be used for creating case notifications in the application.<br /> - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provides a way to communicate on status of a case work in the form of notes to and from integrated applications.<br /> - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide emailing facility on predefined set of events.<br /> - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provides a way to add email text to case notification body.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is rebuild the Status manager application from scratch which is flexible, easy to configure, reliable, presents rich user interface and nicely integrates with client's existing internal applications.</p>","<p>Please refer to the ARS and the <strong>prototype</strong> here <a href=""http://apps.topcoder.com/wiki/display/docs/Morpheus+Status+Manager+Submissions"">http://apps.topcoder.com/wiki/display/docs/Morpheus+Status+Manager+Submissions</a>.

Test Scenarios,Morpheus Status Manager Test Scenarios  2,30023802,3692,11000,"<p>The client of this application has a business where the client receives cases from customers. These cases will be assigned to client's financial advisors and a case notification is created in client's existing application for tracking purpose. Advisors are responsible for handling the cases.&nbsp; After handling the cases, advisors will update the status of the case work at their business office.&nbsp; Thus based on case work completeness, the company CSR will update the status of the cases by updating case notification in the application. The existing application which the client uses is a third party vendor application called Status Manager(SM) Tool.&nbsp; The SM tool provides a single view of client current business status.&nbsp; It provides a set of following functionalities:</p>
<p>- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provides an API to create/update/retrieve/search case notifications<br /> - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provides an API to create/update/ retrieve/delete custom views of case notifications<br /> - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capturing alert emails send to financial advisors from&nbsp; business groups(users from client's internal applications)<br /> - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provides an API to define new notification types (email templates) to be used for creating case notifications in the application.<br /> - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provides a way to communicate on status of a case work in the form of notes to and from integrated applications.<br /> - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide emailing facility on predefined set of events.<br /> - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provides a way to add email text to case notification body.</p>
